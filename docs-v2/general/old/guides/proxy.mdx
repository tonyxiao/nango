This guide shows how to perform authenticated API requests through Nango.

<Tip>
    This feature is free & unlimited on Nango Cloud.
</Tip>

## When to use the Proxy

The **Proxy** makes it faster for you to query external APIs by handling:
* Credential-injection in requests
* Automatically sets the correct base URL
* Logging & monitoring
* Rate-limit handling (with automatic & configurable retries)

It is especially useful for:
* One-off requests to fetch e.g. metadata from the API
* Writing data back to the API on demand

If you want to continuously sync data from the external API, check out [syncs](/guides/sync). If you find yourself to many Proxy requests for a single workflow, checkout [actions](/guides/action).

## Using the Proxy

<Tip>
Before you can use Proxy requests, you need to setup auth by following the [Authorize APIs guide](/guides/oauth).

### Proxy requests 

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Backend Node SDK">

The backend Node SDK supports the Proxy and offers convenience functions such as `nango.get({})`, `nango.post({})` etc.

Refer to the [SDK Reference](/sdks) for full details on proxy options.

```typescript
try {
    const res = await nango.proxy({
        method: 'POST',
        endpoint: '/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList',
        providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
        connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
        retries: 5, // Retries with exponential backoff (optional, default 0)
        data: {
            id: 1,
            colorId: 'blue',
            selected: true
        }
    });

    // Response was 200!
    // See https://axios-http.com/docs/res_schema
    console.log(res.data);
} catch (error) {
    // Status of response != 200
    // See https://axios-http.com/docs/handling_errors
    console.log(error.response.data);
    console.log(error.response.status);
    console.log(error.response.headers);
}
```

<Info>
    Some APIs are not yet fully-configured to work with the Proxy and require you to indicate the base URL. 

    You can check if your API contains the `proxy.base_url` field in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) configuration file.

    If not, you need to add a `baseUrlOverride` field in your call to the Proxy as follow:
    ```typescript
const res = await nango.proxy({
    ...
    baseUrlOverride: 'https://gmail.googleapis.com',
    ...
});
    ```

    Feel free to contribute the `proxy.base_url` field to any API in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) public file, or reach out on the [Slack community](https://www.nango.dev/slack) to ask us to do it.

</Tab>

<Tab title="REST API">

You can use the Proxy with Nango's REST API (cf. [proxy API reference](/api-reference/proxy/get)):

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' \
-H 'Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>' \
-H 'Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>' \
-d '{"colorId: "blue"}' \
'https://api.nango.dev/proxy/<API-ENDPOINT>'
```


<Note>
    Some APIs are not yet fully configured to work with the Proxy and require you to indicate the base URL to use. 

    You can check if your API contains the `proxy.base_url` field in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) configuration file.

    If not, you need to add a `Base-Url-Override` header in your call to the Proxy as follow:
    ```bash
    -H 'Base-Url-Override: https://gmail.googleapis.com' \
    ```

    Feel free to add the `proxy.base_url` field to any API and contribute the change, or reach out on the [Slack community](https://www.nango.dev/slack) to ask us to do it.

### Proxy request logging

All requests that run through the Proxy are automatically logged to the [Activity tab](https://app.nango.dev/activity) in the Nango Dashboard. The logs there can help you debug failing requests.
