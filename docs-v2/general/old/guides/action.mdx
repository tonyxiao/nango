## When should you use _actions_? 

_Actions_ are designed to streamline one-off synchronous workflows that interact with external APIs. Here's what you can achieve with them:
- **Push Updates to External APIs**: Modify a CRM contact field, update a ticket status, and more.
- **Initiate External Events**: Send notifications via email or Slack, and trigger other tasks.
- **Fetch Data in Real-Time**: Instantly retrieve a list of users or other dynamic data.

Moreover, _actions_ incorporate the robust features of the [Proxy](/guides/proxy), allowing you to maintain complex logic within Nango scripts instead of your main codebase. By employing _actions_, you're equipped with:
- Efficient API requests and data transformation.
- Unified schemas across various external APIs.
- Smart rate-limit handling and automatic retries.
- Built-in pagination logic.
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.

# Step 0: API authorization

Start by ensuring the external API you intend to work with is authorized. If not, refer to the [Authorize APIs guide](/guides/oauth) for guidance.

# Step 1: Enable a pre-built _action_

Go to the [Syncs & Actions tab](https://app.nango.dev/syncs).

Toggle on `Actions` and click the `Add New` button.

From the `Provider` dropdown, select the desired API. Choose your desired action using the `Template` dropdown. Click `Add Action` at the page's bottom.

Congratulations! You're now set to trigger this action from your backend.
# Step 2: Trigger an action

_Actions_ are designed to run in real-time and are activated either through the [backend SDK](/sdks) or the [REST API](/api-reference):

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.nango.dev/action/trigger \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <PROJECT-SECRET-KEY>' \
  --header 'Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>' \
  --header 'Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>' \
  --data '{ "action_name": "<ACTION-NAME>", "input": <JSON-INPUT> }'
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Node SDK">

```ts
import { Nango }  from '@nangohq/node';

const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<PROJECT-SECRET-KEY>' });

const result = await nango.triggerAction('<INTEGRATION-ID>', '<CONNECTION-ID>', '<ACTION-NAME>', jsonInput);
```
</Tab>
