<Tip>
    Nango Cloud offers this feature for free and without limits.
</Tip>

This guide walks you through letting your users authorize external APIs directly from within your application.

## Step 1: Get Started with Nango

First, sign up for a free Nango account (no credit card needed):
[![Try Nango Cloud](/images/nango-deploy-button.svg)](https://app.nango.dev/signup)

## Step 2: Create an integration

Visit the [Add New Integration page](https://app.nango.dev/integration/create) and complete the form.

For the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, you'll need to register your OAuth application on the developer portal of the external API you're integrating with.

<Tip>
    To register your OAuth app, find your API within Nango's documentation and go to the `Getting Started` section. For example, check out [Notion](/integrations/all/notion).
</Tip>

When registering, the API provider will prompt you for the `Callback URL`. Use the one displayed at the bottom of Nango's integration page. Remember to also register the required scopes both with the API provider and within Nango's integration page.

## Step 3: Test your integration

Click `Auth` next to the integration to initiate the OAuth flow via Nango.

Once the API authorization is successful, retrieve your access token from the [Connections tab](https://app.nango.dev/connections). Well done! üéâ

## Step 4: Embed Nango in your frontend

To kick-start, install `@nangohq/frontend`.  Then, utilize the code snippet provided on the [Add New Connection page](https://app.nango.dev/connections/create) (from step 3) to initiate OAuth flows from your frontend. Further details can be found in the [Frontend SDK docs](/sdks/frontend).

Here, the `<CONNECTION-ID>` signifies a unique user connection to the integration within Nango. We suggest using a distinctive user ID or a similar identifier.

## Step 5: Access tokens via your backend
For backend operations, either our [Node SDK](/sdks/node) or [REST API](/api-reference/connection/get) can be employed to consistently fetch updated access tokens. These tokens enable you to query the external API.


-   `<INTEGRATION-ID>` represents the name of your integration. Find it on the [Integrations tab](https://app.nango.dev/integrations) in the Dashboard, e.g., `slack`.
-   `<CONNECTION-ID>` corresponds to the Connection ID designated in step 4.

Transition to the [Project Settings tab](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings) to obtain the secret key necessary for fetching the credentials:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="cURL">

```bash
curl --request GET \
        --url https://api.nango.dev/connection/<CONNECTION-ID>?provider_config_key=<INTEGRATION-ID> \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer <SECRET-KEY-FROM-PROJECT-SETTINGS>'
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Node SDK">

```ts
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

let nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<SECRET-KEY>' });

let creds = await nango.getConnection('<INTEGRATION-ID>', '<CONNECTION-ID>');
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>
