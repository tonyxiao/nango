## Free Self-Hosting

Free self-hosting features have been designed with easy self-hostability in mind, ensuring that you can deploy them independently in your own environment.

These features are widely adopted by many companies in production. They simplify the process of obtaining, storing, and refreshing credentials to access any API. The same features are available for free without limitations on Nango Cloud.
