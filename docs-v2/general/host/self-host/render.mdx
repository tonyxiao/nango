### Deployment Information[](#deployment-information 'Direct link to Deployment Information')

The Render Blueprint generates a dedicated Nango Server instance as well as a
separate Postgres database.

This Blueprint defaults to Render's free tier which has some limitations (e.g.
DB is only free for 3 months), but you can easily upgrade the instances in your
Render dashboard.

The environment variables related to the server URL (`NANGO_SERVER_URL`), port
(`SERVER_PORT`) and database credentials are automatically set for you.

If you use a custom domain, you should set the right value for the
`NANGO_SERVER_URL` environment variable on your Render dashboard.
